## 🏗️ Architecture
![Architecture Diagram](files/architecture_diagram.png)

1. **Streamlit Frontend**  
   - Receives user input → calls API Gateway → displays response  
2. **API Gateway**  
   - Routes HTTP requests to AWS Lambda  
3. **AWS Lambda**  
   - Implements business logic  
   - Calls Amazon Bedrock LLM  
   - Queries Faiss vector index for RAG  
4. **Amazon Bedrock**  
   - Hosts and serves the large language model  
5. **Amazon S3**  
   - Stores source documents (PDFs, regulations)  
6. **Faiss**  
   - Embeds S3 documents and performs vector search  

## ⚙️ Installation & Usage

Configure AWS resources
   - Create an S3 bucket and upload visa regulation documents
   - Deploy Lambda function and API Gateway, grant Bedrock invoke permissions
   - Initialize Faiss index with build_faiss_index.py

## Run the local frontend
